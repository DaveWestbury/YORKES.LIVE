# 09/09 ideas
- Discussion forum for beaches, towns and walking trails perhaps?
- Update blender file to reduce polygons and potentially reduce file size?

## old photos
https://veryphotographic.com.au/the-minlaton-museum 

## Increase traffic ideas
- Instagram page? #yorkeslive maybe?
- Add option to purchase prints of the Yorke Peninsula? Could potentially have it linked to other websites as well to increase traffic? 

## In the database - Dave- 
- create catagories for information types. eg beach, wreck.

## Social media ideas /
Instagram, connected to website and uploading straight to the website would be so cool
Selling prints etc with your logo in the corner of beach photos could be another idea?
Little shaka symbol would also be cool!
#yorkeslive would be the tag I think

## Changelog completed
Shipwreck circle locations added on the interactive map
Research shipwreck locations added
Added additional shipwreck information 28/01/2024
