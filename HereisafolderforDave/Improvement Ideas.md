# 09/09 ideas
- Discussion forum for beaches, towns and walking trails perhaps?
- Update blender file to reduce polygons and potentially reduce file size?

## old photos
https://veryphotographic.com.au/the-minlaton-museum 

## Increase traffic ideas
- Instagram page? #yorkeslive maybe?
- Add option to purchase prints of the Yorke Peninsula? Could potentially have it linked to other websites as well to increase traffic? 
Link to other pages on Ezra Magazine (can build up some other article to link back to Yorkes.Live)
Could have a shop page for prints etc (not sure where that file went?)
Creating interactive walking trails with photos, walking signs and hotpost information

## Interactive map 
Include 2-3 sentences about each town, eventually with the idea to have a page with all the towns listed? So someone can view the interactive map, click the town and see info, photos etc?
Users could click each town dot like you have built for each of the beaches 


## SA Tourism Market research
https://southaustralia.com/travel-blog/5-must-visit-yorke-peninsula-beaches pretty basic
https://yorkepeninsula.com.au/beaches super basic, heaps of internal and two external links though
https://yorkepeninsula.com.au/walk-the-yorke/day-walks walking trail information is text based, I think something that might be useful is being able to download a "trip" that would import straight to Google Maps or something similar, so someone can see the trail and not have to look up the exact starting points.


## In the database - Dave- 
- create catagories for information types. eg beach, wreck.

## Social media ideas /
Instagram, connected to website and uploading straight to the website would be so cool
Selling prints etc with your logo in the corner of beach photos could be another idea?
Little shaka symbol would also be cool!
#yorkeslive would be the tag I think


## Changelog completed
Shipwreck circle locations added on the interactive map
Research shipwreck locations added
Added additional shipwreck information 28/01/2024
