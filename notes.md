# 09/09 ideas

- Shipwreck locations on the digital/interactive Blender file when Dave eventually finds the file 
- Expand beach/lighthouse/roads/town // Interactive map of the Yorke Peninsula?
- Discussion forum for beaches, towns and walking trails perhaps?
- Update blender file to reduce polygons and potentially reduce file size?
- Research shipwreck locations. Kind of finished, need to update rest of locations. 


## Increase traffic ideas
- Instagram page? #yorkeslive maybe?
- Add option to purchase prints of the Yorke Peninsula? Could potentially have it linked to other websites as well to increase traffic? 

## In the database
- create catagories for information types. eg beach, wreck.
