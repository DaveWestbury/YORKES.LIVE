# YORKES.LIVE
### Yorke Peninsula's Best Beach List. 
It can be viewed live [https://YORKES.LIVE](yorkes.live)

## An interactive website with 3D rendered map.

An interactive map using [Model Viewer](https://modelviewer.dev/) and its hotspot system to mark locations on the map. Namely beaches. 
The hotspots are rendered from a database onto the map. The website gives the user the ability to vote on their favorite beaches and orders the beaches by votes. 

Looking to continue to add to the project however having issues with DOM size (approx 1400 elements) and intial payload size (approx 5mb). A decent website change will be required to achieve this.
