# RENT-/ HOLIDAY-HOME FRIENDLY FRAMES

Gator foam is fantastically light and rigid, much stronger than traditional foam board. This "frame" is suited to those who love to display pictures but are unable to screw or mount anything into/onto their walls. Gator foam is perfect for mounting using removable strips from your local hardware store, but maintains the quality and integrity of a timeless photograph.

8 x 10 inch (20 x 25 cm) $180 - Suitable for a small bathroom or as part of a series of small images. These little beauties are perfect for displaying as a series to remember your trip by. 
16 x 20 inch (40 x 50 cm) $420 - Suitable for a medium sized wall or at the end of a hallway.
